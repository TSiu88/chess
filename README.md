## Description

This console application was written for Epicodus Intro to Programming and C#/React course.  This was an extension of the Queen Attack project which was made to create a chess board in the console log and have it display.  It was done for all pieces, not just the queen and was supposed to check if moves were valid to do a full chess game using coordinates.

This project is unfinished.  It displays a chess board but pieces are not able to move and see if the move is valid.
